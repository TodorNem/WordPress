# Testing for mod_rewrite
# -----------------------
# If mod_rewrite is enabled, redirect to 1.txt, which returns "1".
# If mod_rewrite is disabled, the rewriting fails, and we end at 0.txt, which returns "0".
#
# Notes:
# - We are not redirecting to a php, because that would additionally require phps
#      to be run in that directory
# - We are wrapping it in a "<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>" and therefore this test also relies
#      on the IfModule directive being allowed. It probably usually is, as it is harmless.
#      Also, it is good practice to use it, so in most cases it is good that this is checked
#      too. Actually, the <IfModule> wrap isn't neccessary for our test to work, as the test
#      identifies a 500 Internal Error as test failure. However, not having the wrap would
#      cause the test to generate an entry in the error log when mod_rewrite isn't installed
#      (regardless if configured to Nonfatal or not): "Invalid command 'RewriteEngine', perhaps
#      misspelled or defined by a module not included
#      in the server configuration"

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteRule ^0\.txt$ 1\.txt [L]
</IfModule>
